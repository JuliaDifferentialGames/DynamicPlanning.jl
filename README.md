# DynamicPlanning.jl


This is a work in progress library for warm-starting differential games via kinodynamic motion planning.


## Immediate Development Plan

1. Develop base types
    - Obstacle
    - Robot
    - Workspace
    - TPBVP
    - Planner
2. Implement Kinodynamic RRT*
3. Define the sample game/games
4. Implement IBR
5. Create the potential function and type
6. Determine a the planning/games loop


## Example

This examples will be used for a final project in ASEN 5254: Algorithmic Motion Planning at CU Boulder.
